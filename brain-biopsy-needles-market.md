<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brain Biopsy Needles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable Brain Biopsy Needles</li><li>Reusable Brain Biopsy Needles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brain biopsy needles are classified into two main types: disposable and reusable. Disposable brain biopsy needles are single-use instruments that are discarded after a single procedure, reducing the risk of contamination and ensuring patient safety. Reusable brain biopsy needles, on the other hand, can be sterilized and used multiple times, making them a more cost-effective option in the long run. Both types of needles play a crucial role in obtaining tissue samples for diagnostic purposes in neurosurgery.</p></p>
