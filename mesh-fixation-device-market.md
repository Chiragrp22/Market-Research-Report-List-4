<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mesh Fixation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Fixation Device</li><li>Non-Absorbable Fixation Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mesh fixation devices are used in hernia repair surgeries to secure mesh prosthetics in place. The market for these devices can be categorized into two main types: absorbable fixation devices and non-absorbable fixation devices. Absorbable devices gradually degrade over time and are eventually absorbed by the body, reducing the risk of long-term complications. Non-absorbable devices, on the other hand, remain in the body permanently. Both types offer different benefits and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient and surgeon.</p></p>
