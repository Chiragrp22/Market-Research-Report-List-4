<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurosurgical Drainage Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Types</li><li>Anti-Siphon Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neurosurgical drainage devices are used to manage conditions like hydrocephalus. Shunt types include ventriculoperitoneal, ventriculoatrial, and lumbo-peritoneal shunts, which redirect excess cerebrospinal fluid to other parts of the body for absorption. Anti-siphon devices are used to prevent over-drainage and complications like headaches and low pressure in the brain. These devices help regulate the flow of fluid and maintain optimal pressure in the intracranial space, providing effective treatment for patients with neurological disorders.</p></p>
