<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Competent Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemically Competent Cells</li><li>Electrocompetent Cells</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Competent cells are specialized cells used in molecular biology techniques such as transformation. Chemically competent cells are treated with chemical agents that increase the permeability of the cell membrane, allowing for the uptake of foreign DNA. Electrocompetent cells, on the other hand, are prepared using electrical pulses to create temporary pores in the cell membrane for DNA uptake. Both types of competent cells are widely used in genetic engineering and research applications, with each method offering distinct advantages for specific experimental needs.</p></p>
