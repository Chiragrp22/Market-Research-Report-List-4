The market growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for air travel globally, which is leading airlines to expand their fleets rapidly. Additionally, the rising costs of aircraft ownership, maintenance, and operation are prompting airlines to opt for leasing as a more cost-effective solution. Moreover, leasing companies are offering innovative leasing options such as sale-and-leaseback agreements, which further fuel market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Aircraft Leasing Market is the increasing demand for narrow-body aircraft leases, driven by the surge in low-cost carriers and regional airlines. Another trend is the rising popularity of operating leases over finance leases, as it offers airlines more flexibility and reduces their exposure to aircraft depreciation risks.
