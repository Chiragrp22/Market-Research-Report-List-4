<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capnography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main-Stream Capnographs</li><li>Side-Stream Capnographs</li><li>Micro-Stream Capnographs</li><li>Capnography Disposables</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capnography market consists of three main types: Main-Stream Capnographs, Side-Stream Capnographs, and Micro-Stream Capnographs. Main-Stream Capnographs directly measure carbon dioxide levels in the patient's respiratory system, while Side-Stream Capnographs draw a sample of the patient's exhaled air to analyze CO2 levels. Micro-Stream Capnographs use a small amount of exhaled air for monitoring. Additionally, there is a market for Capnography Disposables, which includes accessories like sampling lines and filters used in capnography devices for respiratory monitoring.</p></p>
