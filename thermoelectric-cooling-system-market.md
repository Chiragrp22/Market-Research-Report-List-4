<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermoelectric Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage Module</li><li>Multistage Module</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermoelectric cooling systems are divided into two main types: single stage modules and multistage modules. Single stage modules use a single thermoelectric element to create a temperature difference between two sides of the module, providing cooling by absorbing heat on one side and dissipating it on the other. Multistage modules, on the other hand, use multiple thermoelectric elements stacked together to achieve greater cooling capacity and efficiency. These modules are able to achieve lower temperatures compared to single stage modules, making them ideal for more demanding cooling applications.</p></p>
