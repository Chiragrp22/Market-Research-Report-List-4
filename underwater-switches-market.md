<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underwater Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Limit Switches</li><li>Proximity Switches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Underwater switches market consists of two main types - limit switches and proximity switches. Limit switches are used to detect the presence or absence of an object in a specific location underwater, triggering an electrical signal when the object reaches a certain position. On the other hand, proximity switches use sensors to detect the presence of an object without physical contact, making them ideal for underwater environments where direct contact may not be possible. Both types of switches play a crucial role in a variety of underwater applications.</p></p>
