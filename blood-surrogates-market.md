<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Surrogates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HBOC</li><li>PFBOC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blood surrogates are artificial products designed to mimic the functions of blood in medical applications. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) are blood substitutes containing purified hemoglobin molecules, while perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOCs) are composed of oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon compounds. HBOCs are typically used to deliver oxygen to tissues in emergency situations where blood transfusions are not available, while PFBOCs are used primarily for prolonged tissue oxygenation in conditions such as organ preservation. These blood surrogates serve as crucial alternatives to traditional blood transfusions in various medical scenarios.</p></p>
