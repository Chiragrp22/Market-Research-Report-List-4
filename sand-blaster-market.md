<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sand Blaster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Blaster</li><li>Wet Blaster</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sand blasters can be categorized into two main types: dry blasters and wet blasters. Dry blasters use compressed air to propel abrasive materials against a surface for cleaning or etching purposes. On the other hand, wet blasters utilize water mixed with abrasive materials to achieve similar results. Each type has its own advantages and applications, with dry blasters being more commonly used for heavy-duty sandblasting projects while wet blasters are preferred for more delicate surfaces or environments where dust control is a concern.</p></p>
