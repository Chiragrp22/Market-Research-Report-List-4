<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon-expandable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stents</li><li>Drug-eluting Stents</li><li>Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expandable stents are a type of medical device used to treat narrowed or blocked arteries. There are three main types of balloon-expandable stents in the market - bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and bioabsorbable stents. Bare-metal stents are made of metal and are used to provide structural support to the artery. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication to help prevent restenosis or the re-narrowing of the artery. Bioabsorbable stents are designed to dissolve over time, reducing the risk of long-term complications.</p></p>
