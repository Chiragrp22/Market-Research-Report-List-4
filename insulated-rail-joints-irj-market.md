<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulated Rail Joints (IRJ) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Supported IRJs</li><li>Suspended IRJs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) are used in railway systems to provide electrical insulation between sections of rail. There are two main types of IRJs - Supported IRJs and Suspended IRJs. Supported IRJs are mounted on a baseplate and provide physical support to the rail, while Suspended IRJs are hung from the rail and are not in direct contact with the baseplate. Both types of IRJs serve the same purpose of maintaining electrical isolation between rail sections while allowing for smooth passage of trains.</p></p>
