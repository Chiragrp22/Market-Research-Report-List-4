<p><strong>The Plastic Machinery Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic machinery market caters to both thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics applications. Thermoplastics have the ability to be melted and reformed multiple times, making them ideal for products that require repeatability and flexibility. On the other hand, thermosetting plastics undergo a chemical reaction during curing, resulting in a permanent, rigid structure. This makes them suitable for products that require high heat resistance and dimensional stability. The plastic machinery market serves both these markets by providing equipment for processing and molding these different types of plastics.</p></p>
