<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CBCT Dental Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Panel Detectors</li><li>Image Intensifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CBCT Dental Imaging market includes two main types of detectors: Flat Panel Detectors and Image Intensifiers. Flat Panel Detectors utilize a thin film transistor array for digital image capture, offering high image quality and efficiency. On the other hand, Image Intensifiers convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then captured by a camera for image creation. While Flat Panel Detectors are becoming increasingly popular due to their superior image quality and lower radiation dose, Image Intensifiers are still utilized in certain applications.</p></p>
