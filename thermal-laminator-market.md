<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Laminator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coating Thermal Laminator</li><li>Pre-coated Thermal Laminator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal laminators are divided into two main types in the market - coating thermal laminators and pre-coated thermal laminators. Coating thermal laminators require the application of a heat-activated film onto the document or material to be laminated. On the other hand, pre-coated thermal laminators come with a pre-applied adhesive film that only requires heat to activate and seal the document. Both types of thermal laminators offer efficient and reliable lamination solutions for various industries and applications.</p></p>
