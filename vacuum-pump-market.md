<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet vacuum pumps</li><li>Dry vacuum pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum pumps are classified into two main types: wet vacuum pumps and dry vacuum pumps. Wet vacuum pumps use a liquid, usually oil, as a sealant and lubricant to create a vacuum. They are commonly used in applications where a higher level of vacuum is needed. On the other hand, dry vacuum pumps do not require any liquid for operation, making them ideal for applications where contamination from the sealant is a concern. Dry vacuum pumps are more efficient and environmentally friendly compared to wet vacuum pumps.</p></p>
