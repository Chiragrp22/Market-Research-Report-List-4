<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Carbon Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brakes</li><li>Disk Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft carbon brakes can be classified into two main types: drum brakes and disk brakes. Drum brakes are typically used in older aircraft models and consist of brake shoes that press outward against the inside of a spinning drum to slow down the aircraft. In contrast, disk brakes are more commonly found in modern aircraft and use calipers to press brake pads against a rotating disk to achieve braking. Disk brakes offer better performance, lighter weight, and easier maintenance compared to drum brakes.</p></p>
