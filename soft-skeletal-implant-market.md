<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soft Skeletal Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Constructs</li><li>Synthetic Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soft skeletal implants can be classified into two main types: natural constructs and synthetic products. Natural constructs are made from materials that closely resemble the body's own tissues, such as collagen or hyaluronic acid, and are often used in applications where biocompatibility is crucial. Synthetic products, on the other hand, are made from materials like silicone or polyethylene and offer increased durability and flexibility. Both types of soft skeletal implants play a crucial role in replacing or supporting damaged or weakened tissues in the body.</p></p>
