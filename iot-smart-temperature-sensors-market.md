<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IoT Smart Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Sensing</li><li>Non-Contact Sensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>IoT Smart Temperature Sensors have two main market types: Contact Sensing and Non-Contact Sensing. Contact Sensing sensors have physical contact with the object whose temperature is being measured, providing accurate readings but limiting their use in specific scenarios. On the other hand, Non-Contact Sensing sensors can measure temperature from a distance, making them suitable for various applications where physical contact is not possible or desired. Both types play a crucial role in the IoT industry by providing real-time temperature monitoring and control solutions.</p></p>
