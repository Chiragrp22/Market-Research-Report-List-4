<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Meedle Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scroll</li><li>Non-Rolling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The magnetic needle detector market can be categorized into two types: scroll and non-rolling. In the scroll market type, the magnetic needle detector functions by scrolling through the material being tested for foreign objects. In contrast, the non-rolling market type does not require the material to be scrolled through the detector, but rather the detector is stationary and the material is passed over it. Both types of magnetic needle detectors serve the same purpose of detecting foreign objects in various materials.</p></p>
