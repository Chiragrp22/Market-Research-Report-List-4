<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polydioxanone Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monofilament</li><li>Multifilament</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polydioxanone suture market can be categorized into two types based on structure: monofilament and multifilament. Monofilament sutures are single strands of material that are smooth and easy to handle, reducing tissue trauma during insertion. They are less likely to harbor bacteria due to their lack of crevices. On the other hand, multifilament sutures consist of several strands braided together, providing more flexibility and knot security. However, they are more prone to harboring bacteria and causing tissue reactions compared to monofilament sutures.</p></p>
