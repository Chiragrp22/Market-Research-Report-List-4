<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracic Vascular Stent Grafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plastic Thoracic Vascular Stent Grafts</li><li>Metal Thoracic Vascular Stent Grafts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thoracic vascular stent grafts are medical devices used to treat aortic aneurysms and other thoracic aortic diseases. There are two main types of thoracic vascular stent grafts - plastic and metal. Plastic stent grafts are typically made of synthetic materials such as polyester and are more flexible, while metal stent grafts are made of materials like nitinol and are more rigid. Both types of stent grafts are used to reinforce weakened blood vessels and improve blood flow in the thoracic region, but they have different properties and applications.</p></p>
