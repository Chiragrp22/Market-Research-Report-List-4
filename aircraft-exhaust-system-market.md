<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Exhaust System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short Stack System</li><li>Collector System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft exhaust systems can be categorized into two main types: short stack systems and collector systems. Short stack systems consist of individual exhaust pipes for each engine cylinder that exit through a short stack, providing simplicity and ease of maintenance. On the other hand, collector systems gather exhaust from multiple engine cylinders into a single pipe before exiting the aircraft. Collector systems offer better performance by ensuring equal exhaust flow from all cylinders, resulting in improved engine efficiency and reduced noise levels.</p></p>
