<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrically Tunable Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat convex</li><li>Flat Concave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrically tunable lenses come in two main types: flat convex and flat concave. Flat convex lenses have a surface that curves outward, allowing them to bend light towards a focal point. These lenses are often used in applications where magnification is needed, such as in cameras or microscopes. On the other hand, flat concave lenses have a surface that curves inward, causing light to diverge. These lenses are commonly used in applications where a wider field of view is desired, such as in projectors or security cameras.</p></p>
